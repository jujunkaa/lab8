I'm so fierce that it's so nuts
I live to be model thin
Dress me, I'm your mannequin
J'adore, Vivienne, habillez-moi
Gucci, Fendi et Prada
Valentino, Armani too
Merde, I love them Jimmy Choo
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
